### Git Workflow?
  Development branch, master is EXCLUSIVELY used for production ready things. Small pull requests into dev_branch.
  Really good commit messages. Reviewing code before merging and commenting, don't merge your own pull request. Slack when you've made a pull request. Double check that all tests are passing before you open a pull request. Write it in your pull request that all tests are passing. (or needs code review because they are not.). Keep commits and branches small.  

### Personal work/communication style?
  Go on walks together, stay hydrated, if stuck-- relocate.
